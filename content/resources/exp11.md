description: 'The objective of this file is to measure the resonance frequency and
  the quality factor of a driven RLC circuit by

  creating a resonance (frequency response) curve, to see the phase relationships
  between driving voltage and driven current in such a circuit at, below, and above
  the resonance frequency, and to use DataStudio display capabilities to carry out
  these objectives.'
