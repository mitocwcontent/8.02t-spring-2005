description: The objective of this resource is to measure the magnetic fields, to
  observe and measure the forces and torques acting on a magnetic dipole placed in
  an external magnetic field, and to measure quantitatively the force on a magnetic
  dipole on the axis of a ring of current, as a function of the distance from the
  center of the ring.
